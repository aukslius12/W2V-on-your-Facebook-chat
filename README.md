# W2V on your Facebook chat

This is (almost) the same code that I used to visualize Trump's twitter on my (blog)(linkhere, will be updated). It's also interractive!

**How to use**:
  * Download your facebook chat history - [this worked for me](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=246257462227260) *(or you could just google it);*
  * Wait. For a long time. There's an insane ammount of messages;
  * Select your favourite person;
  * Adjust the script minimally (ctrl+f 'directory', 'name'), download the required libraries;
  * Run the notebook / script;
  * Enjoy.
